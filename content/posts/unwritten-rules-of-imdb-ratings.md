I don't remember when my love for movies begun, but it must have something to do with being a child and the amazement of seeing something moving on a screen. I remember the first movies I watched on a medium sized black and white TV that my grandma had and staying up till 2 AM, not being able to turn my attention away from the screen.

It was 1996, I was 6 years old and the only movie that I actually remember watching is [Airplane!](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080339/), hence my broken heart when Leslie Nielsen passed away.  
6 to 12 years old is a blur, but I know the first time I went to a cinema was for [Hannibal](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0212985/). I was 12 and looking back I feel it influenced my movie preferences later in life.

One year later (2003), while using a dial-up connection, I signed up for my IMDb and my data gathering journey began.

Years passed, the number of movies I watched and subsequently rated increased and I'm approaching 2.000 movies watched.  
I already knew I have certain preferences for choosing what to watch and 9 times out of 10 I manage to avoid time wasters. How you ask?

It's actually quite easy to determine if a movie is worth watching based on its genre and IMDb rating. The following criteria assumes the title has at least 3.000-4.000 ratings received.  
There's obviously more movie genres than the ones mentioned below, but I have a non-scientific idea that most of them fall under these 3 categories. A western is never just a western, a science fiction movie is never just about space etc.

### Comedy
  * **lower than 5**: Waste of time
  * **between 5 and 6**: Worth watching, could provide some good laughs
  * **between 6 and 7**: One of the better comedies there is
  * **over 7**: It's either a gem or is a Drama/Comedy and has its rating skewed by the emotional impact, not by its comedic effect

### Thriller / Horror
  * **lower than 4**: Come on, let's be serious
  * **between 4 and 5**: 9 out of 10 times, it's really that bad. But if you dig the synopsis, might give it a shot.
  * **between 5 and 6**: You just can't know for sure. Generally, 5.5 and lower is worse than 5.6 to 6, but it's generally a coin toss.
  * **between 6 and 7**: Pretty good one, go and watch it.
  * **between 7 and 8**: You're in very good movie territory here. It's more often for thrillers to end up with such a high rating. If there's a horror with such a rating, you need to watch it *now*.
  * **over 8**: I don't even know why you're reading this post instead of figuring out a way to watch it.

### Drama
  * **lower than 6**: The only reason to watch these is to laugh at the script, the actors or need some background noise.
  * **6 to 7**: Ehh, you never know. Coin toss.
  * **7 to 8**: Probably a pretty good movie, but since it's a drama, it can either be to your liking or not. They're generally good movies but don't speak to all audiences.
  * **over 8**: Get some napkins or a handkerchief ready, you'll probably be bawling your eyes out.

There are obviously some exceptions, but there's a reason my wife married me - I sure know how to pick a good movie for us.
